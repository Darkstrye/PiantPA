# Logo Assets

Place your PIANT logo image here.

## File Requirements:
- **Filename:** `piant_logo.png`
- **Format:** PNG (recommended) or JPG
- **Location:** `assets/images/piant_logo.png`

## Current Behavior:
- If the logo image exists, it will be displayed in the top right of the login screen
- If the logo image is not found, a text-based "PIANT" logo will be shown as a fallback

## To Add Your Logo:
1. Place your logo image file in this directory (`assets/images/`)
2. Name it exactly: `piant_logo.png`
3. Hot restart the app (press `R` in Flutter terminal or restart the app)

The logo will automatically appear in the top right corner of the login screen.
